A user is invited to a show by his hipster friend; he's never heard of the band. 
He remembers the artist and the location of the show, but forgets the time. 

He uses BC to search for the ARTIST, the tool returns information about the show, 
confirming it's location and informing him about the time.

Because he's never heard of band, he watches one of the videos. He's curious about more - (uses a 'more' button to access bunch of videos to fill him in on their songs?)
